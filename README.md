OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
PROJECT: FILE MANAGEMENT TOOL
OBJECTIVE:
Write: The program first writes the text "This is the first line of data." into example.txt.
Append: It then appends "This is an appended line of data." to the file.
Read and Display: Finally, it reads the content of example.txt line by line and prints each line to the console.
ofstream: Used for writing to files. If the file exists, it will overwrite the file by default unless opened in append mode.
ifstream: Used for reading from files.
ios:: Opens the file in append mode, so new data is added to the end of the file without overwriting it.
